=====================
Below is the list of things I would like to 
=====================


//1 ~~ CRITICAL ISSUES START//

    #C001 - HEROKU WONT DISPLAY BACKGROUND IMAGED [X]
        Console shows that this resource does not exist
        Application tab shows that url will differ.
        http://127.0.0.1:5500/img-min/footer/wok.jpeg
        http://127.0.0.1:5500/app/img-min/orders/sushi-3.jpeg

        seems those do not start from root
        Changed the scss to refer to path:
        background-image: url('/app/img-min/video-presentation/wok.jpeg');

        Seems above fixed the issue on heroku 

        Applying this to other images

        Important! url has to start with / which is root.
        TESTED AND FIXED

    #C002 - PICTURES LOADING TIMES - LOADING ON MOBILES [X]
