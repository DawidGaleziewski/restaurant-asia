=====================
Below is the list of things I would like to 
=====================


//1 ~~ CRITICAL ISSUES START//

    #C001 - HEROKU WONT DISPLAY BACKGROUND IMAGED [X]
        Console shows that this resource does not exist
        Application tab shows that url will differ.
        http://127.0.0.1:5500/img-min/footer/wok.jpeg
        http://127.0.0.1:5500/app/img-min/orders/sushi-3.jpeg

        seems those do not start from root
        Changed the scss to refer to path:
        background-image: url('/app/img-min/video-presentation/wok.jpeg');

        Seems above fixed the issue on heroku 

        Applying this to other images

        Important! url has to start with / which is root.
        TESTED AND FIXED

    #C004 - GIT DOCUMENTATION []
    #C005 - MENU SCROLL AND IDS FOR SECTIONS []
    #C006 - when resizing the hamburger wont work []
        issue is a bit deeper - main problem is due the fact that the script will check if the device is mobile.
        and the burger occurs also on desktop when small enough

        ides to solve
        1. Use display property of burger -
            this seems to bad considering the fact how js will handle css:
            https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/getattribute-wont-get-a-display-attribute/5571

        2. Check width of the site in function that is invoked with event listener when resizing?
